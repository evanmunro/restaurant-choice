# CS230 Final Project Code Repository 

The repository contains the code used in my CS230 Project "Deep Learning for Restaurant Choice". The repository is made up of a Jupyter Notebook, 5 executable python files, and 1 python file containing classes written for this project.  

- prepareRestaurantData.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook used to prepare the restaurant choice data and calculate summary statistics. 
- testModel.py loads a saved neural network model and calculates test error and accuracy on the test set. 
- test_rnn.py loads a saved recurrent neural network model and calculates test error and accuracy on the test set. 
- choice_nn_estimation.py estimates the basic neural network or the conditional logit model  
- choice_rnn_estimation.py estimates the RNN neural network 
- choiceModels.py contains the PyTorch classes written for the project: RNN and Neural Network Dataset classes and Model architectures
